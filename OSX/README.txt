About Revolution R Open
-----------------------
Revolution R Open builds on R 3.1.2 by making the following
additions and changes:

Revolution R Open is linked with the Mac
Accelerate Framework, enabling multi-threaded computation.

The default CRAN repository for Revolution R Open is
http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/snapshot/2014-12-01/.

Unlike a CRAN mirror, this is a static copy of CRAN,
created on Dec 1, 2014. Newer versions of packages will
not appear in this repository. To access newer versions of
packages, choose a CRAN mirror or use the checkpoint
package described below.

Revolution R Open installs the checkpoint package (part of
the Reproducible R Toolkit). You can use the checkpoint
package to access recent package versions and to share
reproducible R code with others. Visit
http://projects.revolutionanalytics.com/rrt/
for information about how to use the checkpoint package to
manage R package versions.
